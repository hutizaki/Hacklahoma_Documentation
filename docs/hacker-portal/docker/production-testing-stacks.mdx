# Production and Testing Stacks

**Production:** Uses prod Compose (e.g. `docker-compose.prod.yml` or dev compose with `config/.env.prod`). Containers are named by project (e.g. `hackportal_prod`).

**Testing stack (TEST_PROD):** Used by CI and optional local validation. Project name **`testing_hackportal`**; containers like `testing_hackportal-backend-prod`, `testing_hackportal-frontend-prod`. **Ports 9080 (frontend) and 9081 (backend)** in `config/.env.ci` so the stack doesn't use 80/5001 and doesn't conflict with dev or prod.

The CLI never runs `down` on `testing_hackportal`; the pipeline only runs `up` (no `down`), so the two stay isolated.
