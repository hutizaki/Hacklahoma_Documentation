# Docker Overview

Docker gives dev/prod parity and powers CI and production deploys.

- **Development** — `docker-compose.dev.yml` + `config/.env.dev`; MongoDB, backend, frontend, Mongo Express; hot reload.
- **Production** — `docker-compose.prod.yml` (or dev compose with prod env) + `config/.env.prod`.
- **Mock production** — `docker-compose.mock-prod.yml` for integration testing.
- **CI / testing stack** — Override uses project name `testing_hackportal`, ports 9080/9081 so it doesn't conflict with local dev.
- **Blue-green** — Pipeline deploys TEST_PROD by pulling images by digest, starting the new color, health-checking, then switching the proxy.

Each environment uses its own Compose project name so the CLI and pipeline don't tear down each other's containers.
