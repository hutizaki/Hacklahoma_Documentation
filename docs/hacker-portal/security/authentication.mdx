# Authentication

HackPortal uses **JWT in httpOnly cookies** for sessions.

## Flow

1. **Register** — `POST /api/auth/register`; password hashed with bcrypt; user created (no token yet).
2. **Login** — `POST /api/auth/login`; credentials checked; JWT issued and set in an httpOnly cookie; session stored.
3. **Authenticated requests** — Cookie sent automatically; middleware validates JWT and attaches `req.user`.
4. **Logout** — `POST /api/auth/logout`; cookie cleared and session invalidated.
5. **Session check** — `GET /api/auth/me` returns the current user when the cookie is valid.

Cookies use `secure` in production and `sameSite` (e.g. `lax` for localhost, `strict` for production) so browsers send them only to the correct origin.
