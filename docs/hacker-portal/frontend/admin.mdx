# Admin Panel (Dev Only)

**Route:** `/admin`. **Dev-only** — User, role, and permission management; feature flags; session and activity views. Not enabled in production; backend admin endpoints are gated by `NODE_ENV` or role.

Used for development and debugging. In production, use the CLI or direct DB access for admin tasks.
