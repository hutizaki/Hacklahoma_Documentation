# Login and Logout

**Login:** `/login` — User submits email and password. Backend validates, issues a JWT, sets an httpOnly cookie, and returns user data. The app redirects to dashboard or the intended page.

**Logout:** User triggers logout; frontend calls `POST /api/auth/logout`; cookie is cleared and session invalidated.

Cookies are sent automatically with requests (`withCredentials`); protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated.
