# Scan Flow

Staff can scan participants (e.g. check-in) via **camera** or **web app**. The flow requires a **secure context** (HTTPS or localhost) for camera access. The app can run as a **PWA** for mobile scanning.

Details (secure context, PWA, camera permissions) are in the hacker-portal repo: `docs/development/scan-flow.md`.
