# Other User Routes

- **Profile** — `/profile/:userId` — View a user's public profile.
- **Join Team** — `/join-team` — Team formation / join flow.
- **Social** — `/social` — Social or community features.
- **Settings** — `/settings` — App preferences (e.g. notifications, theme).

All are under the same auth and routing setup; protected routes redirect to login when needed.
