# Registration

**Route:** `/register`. New users sign up with email, password, and name. The backend validates input (e.g. Zod), hashes the password, and creates the user. After registration, the user can log in.

Validation and error messages are shown inline. The flow aligns with the backend auth contract (see [Authentication](/docs/hacker-portal/security/authentication)).
