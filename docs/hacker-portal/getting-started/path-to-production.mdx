# Developer to Production (Overview)

High-level path from your machine to a live site.

1. **Install** — Clone, install Node/pnpm and Docker, run CLI Quick Easy Setup, deploy Development.
2. **Develop** — Edit code in `frontend/src` and `backend/src`; hot reload applies changes.
3. **Submit** — Commit, push, open a merge request to `main`.
4. **CI** — Pipeline runs: format → lint → build → unit tests → E2E → publish digest → deploy TEST_PROD (blue-green).
5. **Merge** — Merge to `main`; pipeline runs again and updates TEST_PROD.
6. **Live production** — On the production server: pull `main`, rebuild images, restart the compose stack (or use CLI Deploy Production).

The **testing stack** (TEST_PROD) is updated by CI. The **live production site** (e.g. register.hacklahoma.org) is updated manually or via your deploy process on the server.
