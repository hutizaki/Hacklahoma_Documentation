# TEST_PROD and Blue-Green

The pipeline updates **TEST_PROD** (testing stack) via the **deploy:test_prod** job: pull frontend and backend by digest, start new color, health-check, switch proxy, stop old color. One deployment at a time (resource_group).

**Live production** (e.g. register.hacklahoma.org) is **not** updated by CI; it is updated on the server (pull, rebuild, restart) or by your own deploy process. TEST_PROD is for validation and staging; production is a separate step.
