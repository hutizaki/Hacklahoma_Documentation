# LAN HTTPS

For local HTTPS (e.g. **https://&lt;LAN-IP&gt;:8443**) so you can test from a phone on the same Wi‑Fi with a single origin and no CORS/cookie hacks:

- Use the CLI or scripts to set up LAN dev env (e.g. `config/.env.lan-dev` with your LAN IP).
- Certificates can be self-signed; the CLI/docs describe how to generate and trust them for mobile.

Details: `cli/docs/lan-https-certificates.md` in the hacker-portal repo.
