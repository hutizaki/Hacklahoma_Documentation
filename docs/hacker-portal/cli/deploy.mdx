# CLI Deploy

**Deployment → Deploy Environment** — Choose Development, Mock Production, or Production. The CLI validates config, shows the plan, builds images, stops existing containers (with cleanup), starts the stack, and checks health.

Each environment uses a **distinct Compose project name** (e.g. `hackportal_dev_lan_https`, `hackportal_prod`) so `down` only affects that environment, not the pipeline's testing stack.
