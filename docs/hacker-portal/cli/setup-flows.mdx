# CLI Setup Flows

- **Prerequisites Check** — Shows Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js, disk space; links to install instructions. Read-only.
- **Quick Easy Setup** — Full wizard: check env files, run prerequisites, select environment (Development / Mock Production / Production), generate secrets, write env file, prompt to run setup script. Recommended for first-time setup.
- **Initial Configuration** — Similar to Quick Easy; runs prerequisites then Quick Easy. Use Quick Easy as the single path for newcomers.
